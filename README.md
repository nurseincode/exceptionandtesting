# exceptionandtesting

## try / except / finally
- 3 blocks of code
- 'try' block - contains code that might raise an exception
- 'except' block - multiple; contains code that handles the exception ('catch' in other langs)
- 'finally' - contains code that executes always (whether there is an exception or not)

## Testing
- Allows developers to confirm that the app works correcly and as intended (or not!)
- It helps us catch bugs early (i.e before runtime)

## Types of Testing
- Manual: Where a dev actually sits there and operates the app, trying to break it
- Automated: Tests are code
